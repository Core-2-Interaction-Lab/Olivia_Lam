    <P>
        1. a. I have taken Interaction 1 and 2 during the previous year. <br>
        1. b. I resonated with understanding the basics of html and css 
        as well as creating certain web animations. <br>
        1. c. The most confusing part was to implement javascript into 
        customizing the layout of the website. <br><br>

        2. Upon being exposed to the possibilities of code during the previous semesters,
        I am super excited to explore more and discover what I can do with webpage design.
        I am a little worried about javascript but I know
        there are a lot of useful resources that can help, as well as asking the teacher
        and attending tutoring sessions. <br><br>

        3. I imagine coding fitting in with web page designing, it is also a valuable building
        block for a lot of different career paths in the design industry.<br><br>

        4. I have only used sublime in the past but visual code editor seems more convenient.
        <br><br>

        5. I have used GitHub before but I only have a basic understanding of this platform.
        I think of it as a google drive for coding and you can also publish your pages. <br><br>

        6. HTML consists of the media that would be displayed on a webpage, CSS is responsible
        for customizing the appearance of said media, and JavaScript allows for unique functions
        that enhances the user's experience. <br><br>

        7. Favorite food ranking: <br>
        <h1>sushi</h1>
        <h2>udon</h2>
